# RESTrip

Automatically extract data from multiple (subsequent or parallel) REST API endpoints based on simple configuration files and create offline copies from them. Created to easily build alternative offline frontends for apps I need but don't want to keep installed.

## Usage

...

## TODOs

- [x] Add maximum allowable age to all endpoints (with a useful default) and check if files for them already exist
- [ ] Investigate alternatives to `jq.py` to allow for Windows usage [^0]
